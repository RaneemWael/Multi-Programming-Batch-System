# Multi-Programming-Batch-System
An operating system simulation implemented using Java.

## Description:

Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects similar jobs together in a batch and then starts executing the batches sequentially, one job at a time. 
In a multi-programmed batch system, the CPU will never be idle. The Operating System keeps multiple jobs in the main memory, these are the jobs waiting to be executed. 
The Operating System will choose one of these jobs and begins execution. Once this job needs an I/O operation, the Operating System switches to another job. If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the Operating System chooses which one to run through the process of CPU Scheduling.

#### OS simulation using Java:
- System Calls
- Processors
- Semaphores
- Scheduler

#### More information:

You can find a report and presentation within the files that detail the implementation and how to run/use it.

## How to run:
- Download project file to your computer as zip.
- Import into Eclipse IDE as existing archive and run!
